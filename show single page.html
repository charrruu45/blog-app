   <p>The 2024 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC COP 29) will convene in November 2024 in Baku, Azerbaijan.
    This event will include the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 29), the 19th meeting of the COP serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 19), and the sixth meeting of the COP serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 6) that will convene to complete the first enhanced transparency framework and the new collective quantified goal on finance, among other matters. The 61st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 61) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 61) will also meet.
    On 21 March 2024, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) COP 28 Presidency, the Azerbaijani COP 29 Presidency, and the Brazilian COP 30 Presidency sent out a letter to parties, in which the Presidencies Troika outlines a ‘Roadmap to Mission 1.5°C,’ to “significantly enhance international cooperation and the international enabling environment to stimulate ambition in the next round of nationally determined contributions, with a view to enhancing action and implementation over this critical decade and keeping 1.5°C within reach”.
    The COP Presidencies Troika indicated it intends to host a series of high-level political convenings to assess barriers to NDC development, including meetings during the Germany-hosted 15th Petersberg Climate Dialogue, the 60th sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies (SBs), the 79th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), and a special session at the opening of the 29th session of the Conference Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 29). These meetings will discuss the “quantity and quality of support needed” to ensure NDCs, the next round of which is due in 2025, can deliver just climate transitions aligned with the 1.5°C goal. The Presidencies will also work with “key thematic and political platforms” such as the Group of 20 (G20), “to channel existing knowledge and resources towards ambitious NDC development”.
